# UIOT

This repository include my firmware code, stl 3D print file and schematics.

# Get Started

The arduino firmware is inside the `Firmware` folder. Use it with the Blynk App. It is really easy to setup.

The `stl` files are the 3D Model used in my project. Open it with Cura and print it with your favourite printer.

The schematics are `sch` files. You'll need to have Autodesk Eagle installed to open them. Alternatively if you don't have Eagle installed, you can look at the image version instead.

Have fun!
