# Universal Internet Of Things

This repository include my firmware code, 3D design and schematics for my Universal Internet Of Things project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZixjY8w6qc

# Get Started

The arduino firmware is inside the `Firmware` folder. Use it with the Blynk App. Ensure you have the correct Virtual Button selected.

The `stl` files in the 3D Printing folder are the model used in my project. Open it with Ultimaker Cura and print it with out your favourite printer.

The schematics are `sch` files. You'll need to have Autodesk Eagle installed to open them. Alternatively if you don't have Eagle installed, you can look at the image version instead.

Have fun!
